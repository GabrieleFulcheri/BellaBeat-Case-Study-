## CASE DESCRIPTION

### *What is Bellabeat?*

[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/) is an high-tech company that
manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity,
sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower
women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly
positioned itself as a **tech-driven wellness company for women**. By
2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched
multiple products, focusing extensively on digital marketing to place
them.

### *Main Stakeholders*

-   **Urška Sršen**: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer

-   **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member
    of the Bellabeat executive team

### *Business Task*

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data
would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing
analytics team to **focus on a Bellabeat product** and analyze smart
device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already
using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like
high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat
marketing strategy.

She then asked to analyze the data of non-bellabeat users, in order to
gain insight on how customers use this type of fitness smart devices and
how to apply this insight to improve Bellabeat’s marketing strategy

### *Choosen Product*

**Time**: a fitness watch that tracks activity, sleep and stress
